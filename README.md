# odin-recipes

odin-recipes is a noob friendly recipes website. It groups simple, but delicious easy-to-make meals even for those who struggle to cut butter.

## Overview

The main purpose of this project is to practice my HTML and Git skills. But I hope it also serves as last minute resource for that special unplanned dinner.

## Contents

This website`s recipes are carefully sorted into three main groups:

 + Main courses
 + Desserts
 + Alcoholic drinks

## Structure

odin-recipes follows a standard HTML5 directory structure pattern. Here you will find:

 + Absolute and relative links
 + Embedded images
 + Accessibility features, such as alternative text
 
## Usage

This website does not require any installation whatsoever. Simply access the URL with your browser of choice.

## Credits

This project is fully based on [Lesson 22](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) from [The Odin Project's website](https://www.theodinproject.com).
