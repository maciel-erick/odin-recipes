<p>I know you all have been waiting for this part. Honestly, so was I.</p>
<p>And nothing better than a classic to get us started. Today you will learn how to make the best and simplest lime caipirinha!</p>
<p>For those who've never heard of it, caipirinha is a brazilian cocktail made with cachaça (a distilled spirit made from sugarcane), fruits and sugar.</p>
<p>But don't take it for granted! Tough deliciously refreshing, it can easily knock you out since you can barely taste the alcohol flavor within it.</p>
<p>Be sure to stick to recipe until the end. I'll give you some tips to level up your caipirinha!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>2 limes</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>2 ounces cachaça</li>
    <li>1 cup ice</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Cut the limes into wedges</li>
    <li>Put them into a caipirinha glass</li>
    <li>Add the sugar</li>
    <li>Muddle gently until most of the juice is squeezed out of the lime</li>
    <li>Add the ice</li>
    <li>Slowly pour the cachaça over the ice</li>
    <li>Fill the glass with more ice if possible</li>
    <li>Gently stir the cocktail</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tips</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Remove the white part from the lime wedges (which was the core of the fruit). If you don't, it can bitter the whole cocktail</li>
    <li>Do muddle only the necessary to release the juices. Don't overdo it!</li>
    <li>You can use a shredded ice, if you want to. But the cocktail will get diluted faster as well</li>
    <li>You can also use a pitcher. The method is the same</li>
    <li>For hot days, you can sink a lemon popsicle in the cocktail. You will love it, I guarantee</li>
    <li>For garnishing, you can use lime-peel twists or slices</li>
</ul>
