<p>This is an everyone's favorite: mac and cheese!</p>
<p>The simplicity of this dish doesn't translate into how damn good it is! DEAR LORD!</p>
<p>So c'mon kids, grab your cooking aprons and stick with me!</p>
<p>Oh, just a reminder: though simple, this macaroni sauce is made of pure milk, basically (and cheese).</p>
<p>So, I <strong>really</strong> wouldn't recommend it to lactose intolerant folks. But I promise I'll come up with a recipe just fou you guys!</p>
